+**You need to write automated tests for the https://www.saucedemo.com/ website**
+
+Functionality that needs to be covered by automated tests:
+
+## Authentication
+
+1. Authentication using correct data (standard_user, secret_sauce)
+2. Authentication using incorrect data (user, user)
+
+## Shopping Cart
+
+1. Adding a product to the cart via the catalog
+2. Removing a product from the cart via the cart
+3. Adding a product to the cart from the product card
+4. Removing a product from the cart via the product card
+
+## Product Card
+
+1. Successful transition to the product card after clicking on the product image
+2. Successful transition to the product card after clicking on the product name
+
+## Order Checkout
+
+1. Order checkout using correct data
+
+## Filter
+
+1. Testing the filter functionality (A to Z)
+2. Testing the filter functionality (Z to A)
+3. Testing the filter functionality (low to high)
+4. Testing the filter functionality (high to low)
+
+## Burger Menu
+
+1. Log out
+2. Testing the "About" button functionality in the menu
+3. Testing the "Reset App State" button functionality

+The main essence of this task is to try Selenium and Pytest in practice.
+To complete the task, you need to create a new repository and write a certain number of automated tests.
+
+**Installing Dependencies**
+To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:
+```sh
+>pip install -r requirements.txt
+
+```
